# CubesticleCourse

This is the result of my first time messing around on Unity 3D.

In CubesticleCourse, the player must navigate 3 levels of obstacles to reach the end without falling off.

In this project, I learned the basics of Unity 3D, including:
-  3D physics and collision detection
-  3D Sprite movement and object scripts
-  The role of game managers
-  Animations and switching between scenes using scene managers
-  3D game area creation and level design
-  Various camera movement scripts
